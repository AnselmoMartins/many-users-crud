  login route:
  json needed to send (example) :

  {
      "email": "admin@teste.com",
      "password": "123456"
  }

  this returns:
    {
      "id": 2,
      "email": "admin@teste.com",
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.  eyJpZCI6MiwiaWF0IjoxNTk0Njc1MTQ5LCJleHAiOjE1OTUyNzk5NDl9.RKmJENSH_Llot05
      z5Yih99oEuJ8bZ8comWQx6DeZGXc"
    }
```

```
[2] - /users
  create users route:
  json needed to send (example) :
  * === required.
  {
  	"users": [
  		{
  			*"email":"testone@hotmail.com",
  			*"password": "123456",
  			*"name" : "tester",
  			"phones": [
  				{
  					"phone": "991231508"
  				}
  			]
  			"addresses:" [
  			    {
  			        "zipCode": "84015200",
  			        "street": "teste avenue 200",
  			        "city": "Ponta Grossa",
  			        "state": "PR",
  			        "number": 25,
  			        "complement": 'a complement',
  			    },
  			    {
  			        "zipCode": "84015201",
  			        "street": "teste avenue 201",
  			        "city": "Ponta Grossa",
  			        "state": "PR",
  			        "number": 26,
  			        "complement": 'a complement',
  			    }
  			]
  		},
  		{
  			*"email":"testertwo@hotmail.com",
  			*"password": "123456",
  			*"name" : "testertwo",
  			"phones": [
  				{
  					"phone": "991219508"
  				},
  				{
  					"phone": "991219507"
  				},
  			]
  		}
  	]
  }

  a user hasToMany (address and phones), so you can register multiples
  users with multiples addresses and phones, in just once.
```

### Put
```
    [1] /users
        self-edit user route, just for test experience, you may not send
        user id by req.params, the many-users-crud  catch it by your JWT token.

    json needed to send (example) :
    {
    	"name": "testing edit",
    	"email": "changing user email",
    	"oldPassword": "123456"
    	"password": "12345678",
    	"confirmPassword: 12345678",
    	"phones": {
    		"remove": [
    			{
    				"id": 2
    			},
    			{
    				"id": 10
    			}
    		],

    		"add": [
    			{
    				"phone": "991239591"
    			},
    			{
    				"phone": "991239590"
    			}
    		],

    		"edit": [
    		    {
    		        "id": 5,
    		        "phone": "991239590
    		    }
    		]
    	},
    	"addresses": {
    		"add": [
    			{
    				"zipCode": "84015200",
    				"city": "Ponta Grossa",
    				"state": "PR",
    				"street": "av ernani batista rosas 3131",
    				"number": "3131",
    				"complement": "aquele l√°"
    			}
    		]
    	}
    }
```

```
as you can see, its possible to put multiple addresses, and multiple phones.
How its work:
Inside of an object (addresses, or phone) you can send three arrays(no one is
required)
The arrays are: add:[], edit: [], remove:[],
 [1] add - array of objects to register on database, (the object is similar to post /users route)
 [2] edit - array of objects similar to add but need object id, to edit the object by id on databas
 [3] remove: - array of objects "id", to remove it from database.
```

### Delete
```
    [1] /users/:id
        Delete a user from database,

    all you need to do is to send a user id in req.params

    when user is deleted, his phones and address go down too (by cascade).
```
